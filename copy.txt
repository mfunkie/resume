Senior Software Engineer 2008- Blackbaud, Inc. Charleston, South Carolina

• Participated as an active member in a scrum team using rapid development to produce
new and iterative features of software on time reliably.
• Developed ticketing software from the initial development stages to the release to clients.
• Created pages for ticketing software utilizing an internal platform that uses XML and SQL
on the server-side, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the client-side.
• Served as a mentor and lead engineer on the build team for all next generation products for the
company.
• Wrote utilities for patching and releasing software, significantly reducing the time to release a patch.



Extra blah blah
• Wrote utilities to handle the conversion from Visual Studio 2008 to 2010 and the .NET
Framework 3.5 to 4.0 for over one thousand source-controlled project files. These utilities proved to be re-usable to alter large amounts of project files when build structure changes needed to be enacted.
• Supported product releases with source control branching and maintaining control over the patching process for all developers.
• Altered the build and wrote utilities to automate aspects of the patch process with a shorter turnaround time for patching that resulted in a much larger amount of patches released in the span of one year.
• Upgraded all builds and build machines to support the upgrade to TFS 2012.


· Participated as an active member in a scrum team using rapid development to produce new and iterative features of software on time on a constant basis.

· Restructured the nightly build process to separate building from deployment which de-coupled different products from each other.  This allowed these products to have their own build processes while still having the benefit of consuming the Platform on which all of these products are built.
